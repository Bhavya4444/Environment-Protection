    <p>Environmental protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, groups and governments. Its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and, where possible, to repair damage and reverse trends.Environmental Protection includes programs that are aimed at reducing risks to the environment from contaminants such as hazardous materials and wastes, fuels, and oils.  These programs address pollution prevention measures and regulatory compliance by providing procedures for safely working with these materials, inspecting the storage vessels and locations, and designating preventative maintenance procedures.  Also included are environmental emergency plans, which provide the appropriate actions to be taken in the event of a spill or release.</p>To reduce air, water and land pollution. To facilitate the conservation of natural resources for our future generations. To ensure the protection of biodiversity. To implement sustainable development.Environmental protection is improving, defending, and maintaining the quality of the environment. The main methods of environmental protection are recycling, reusing, and reducing; however, some other methods such as Green Energy production, green transportation development, and eco-friendly industrialization also exist. Not only residents but also businesses and industries should play their basic roles to improve the environment.</p>

    <p>Tree planting is the process in which seedlings are transplanted generally for forestry, land reclamation, or landscaping purposes. Tree plantation is very necessary because trees provide oxygen to the environment and make the air quality better. If more trees are planted, then the world's environment will become a safer place to live in. Tree plantation also reduces pollution, thus making the life of future generations secure. Through this tree plantation essay, one will have a clear overview of this topic.The tree is the key to a pollution-free environment for a long time because they are responsible for providing oxygen, improving the quality of air, climate amelioration, conserving water, soil preservation, and supporting wildlife. Due to all these reasons, tree plantation has become necessary in the present scenario as pollution is at a peak. Tree plantation is the only way to control pollution to some extent.Tree Plantation drives combat many environmental issues like deforestation, erosion of soil, desertification in semi-arid areas, global warming and hence enhancing the beauty and balance of the environment. Trees absorb harmful gases and emit oxygen resulting in an increase in oxygen supply.Tree plantation is very necessary because trees provide oxygen to the environment and make the air quality better. If more trees are planted, then the world's environment will become a safer place to live in. Tree plantation also reduces pollution, thus making the life of future generations secure.</p>

    <p>
        Pollution stunts economic growth, exacerbates poverty and inequality in both urban and rural areas, and significantly contributes to climate change. Poor people, who cannot afford to protect themselves from the negative impacts of pollution, end up suffering the most.<br>
        <h2><font size="4" color="green">The three major types of pollution are air pollution, water pollution, and Soil pollution.</font></h2><br>
        <h2><font size="5" color="blue"><u>1.Air Pollution:</font></u></h2>
        Air pollution refers to the release of harmful contaminants (chemicals, toxic gases, particulates, biological molecules, etc.) into the earth’s atmosphere. These contaminants are quite detrimental and in some cases, pose serious health issues. Some causes that contribute to air pollution are:<br>
        1.Burning fossil fuels<br>
        2.Mining operations<br>
        3.Exhaust gases from industries and factories<br>

        <h2><font size="5" color="blue"><u>2.Water Pollution:</font></u></h2>
        Water pollution is said to occur when toxic pollutants and particulate matter are introduced into water bodies such as lakes, rivers and seas. These contaminants are generally introduced by human activities like improper sewage treatment and oil spills. However, even natural processes such as eutrophication can cause water pollution.
        Other significant causes of water pollution include:<br>
        1.Dumping solid wastes in water bodies<br>
        2.Disposing untreated industrial sewage into water bodies<br>
        3.Human and animal wastes<br>
        4.Agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilisers,<br>

        <h2><font size="5" color="blue"><u>3.Soil Pollution:</font></u></h2>
        Soil pollution, also called soil contamination, refers to the degradation of land due to the presence of chemicals or other man-made substances in the soil. The xenobiotic substances alter the natural composition of soil and affect it negatively. These can drastically impact life directly or indirectly. For instance, any toxic chemicals present in the soil will get absorbed by the plants. Since plants are producers in an environment, it gets passed up through the food chain. Compared to the other types of pollution, the effects of soil pollution are a little more obscured, but their implications are very noticeable.
        Some of the common causes of soil pollution are:<br>
        1.Improper industrial waste disposal<br>
        2.Oil Spills<br>
        3.Mining activities<br>
        4.Intensive farming and agrochemicals (like fertilisers and pesticides)<br>
        5.Industrial accidents<br>

    <h2><u><center><font size="6" color="red">Garbages and Drainages</font></center></u></h2>
    <center><image src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-57355724,imgsize-1179610,width-400,resizemode-4/57355724.jpg"width="500px" height="300"></center></image>
    <p>Every household in Newcastle deals with rubbish on a daily basis. Many families use skip bins, their local recycling centres, and waste removal services to dispose of their waste. From simple household rubbish to the commercial waste of businesses, proper removal of rubbish matters. However, there are still those who choose to dispose of their rubbish themselves. This is where the problem arises, especially when toxic wastes are involved.A common problem with poor drainage is erosion—water that runs over land and down slopes without catch basin or trench drain containment carries soil, mulch, and debris with it and robs trees and plants of nutrients.Poor drainage caused by the shape of the landscape or inadequate drainage systems can damage buildings and move soil from where it’s needed to where it causes trouble. The effects of poor drainage systems extend beyond single properties and can have an impact on roads, waterways, and health.</p>

    <center><image src="https://charity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/environment-recolored_option-2.png"width="500px" height="300"></center></image>
    <p>1.Reduce, reuse, and recycle. Cut down on what you throw away.<br>
       2.Buy products with less packaging.<br>
       3.Avoid disposable products.,<br>
       4.Don't buy single-use plastics.<br>
       5.Shop locally, shop organically.<br>
       6.Invest in a reusable water bottle.<br>
       7.Make sure your waste goes to the right place.<br>
    </p>

     <h2><u><font size="5" color="red">The Goals of Environment Protection</font></u></h2>
     <p>There are three main goals of environmental protection:<br>
1.To protect human health: This is the most important goal of environmental protection because humans cannot survive without a healthy environment.<br>
2.To protect ecosystems: Ecosystems are the foundation of life on Earth, and they provide many benefits to humans, such as clean air and water, food, and fiber.<br>
3.To promote sustainable development: Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.<br></p>
    

   
        <h2><u><font size="5" color="red">Conclusion:</font></u></h2>
        <p>Every household in Newcastle deals with rubbish on a daily basis. Many families use skip bins, their local recycling centres, and waste removal services to dispose of their waste. From simple household rubbish to the commercial waste of businesses, proper removal of rubbish matters. However, there are still those who choose to dispose of their rubbish themselves. This is where the problem arises, especially when toxic wastes are involved.ConclusionWith pollution increasing each year and causing deterioration of the natural environment, it has become necessary to take steps to protect the natural environment. As we know that the reason for all these problems is humans, governments should make policies to restrict their activities that are causing harm to the environment. If they are not stopped urgently, then the world might see some catastrophic destruction in the coming years. For example, climate change has been a huge problem, and this is one of the causes of increased pollution. A secured future depends on the environment as a whole.
